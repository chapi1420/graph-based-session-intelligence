# Graph-Based Session Intelligence: Modeling, Recommendation, and Analysis

This project implements a framework for analyzing and predicting user behavior in session-based systems using a **Graph Database** (Neo4j). The work aligns with the curriculum and objectives outlined in the **Tibebe Solomon Training Summary Document**.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to demonstrate how graph-based systems offer **continuous learning, interpretability, and scalable data traversal** for solving common challenges in session analysis, such as next-step prediction and pattern discovery.

The core intelligence is derived from transforming linear event sequences into a rich graph structure, allowing for efficient, contextual reasoning via **graph traversal** and **co-occurrence logic**.

## Core Methodology: Graph Data Modeling

Session data is modeled using two primary node types and two relationship types, capturing sequence continuity and context.

### Schema Summary

| Element       | Label/Type    | Description                                      | Key Attributes               |
| :---          | :---          | :---                                            | :---                         |
| **Node**      | **`:Event`**  | Represents a unique action or item (e.g., product view). | `id`, `global_count`         |
| **Node**      | **`:Session`**| Represents a complete sequence of user interactions. | `id`, `start_ts`             |
| **Relationship** | **`:OCCURRED_IN`** | Links an **`:Event`** to the **`:Session`** it belongs to. | `index` (Step order), `ts` (Timestamp) |
| **Relationship** | **`:NEXT`** | Links one **`:Event`** to the subsequent **`:Event`** based on aggregated transition frequency. (Fulfills the conceptual `ConnectedTo` role). | `count` (Transition frequency), `avg_duration_ms` |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the `main.ipynb` notebook, you will need:

1. **Python 3.x**
2. **Neo4j Desktop or Server:** A running instance of the Neo4j Graph Database.
3. **Neo4j Credentials:** You must update the connection details (URI, User, Password) in the notebook's initial setup cells.

### Installation

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy neo4j tqdm
